# 0x1B. Web Stack Debugging #4

## Introduction
This project focuses on troubleshooting and fixing issues in a web stack. The primary goal is to understand and resolve common problems that can occur in web servers, applications, databases, and other components of a web stack.

## Objectives
- Identify and diagnose issues in a web stack.
- Apply debugging techniques to resolve web stack problems.
- Enhance skills in managing and maintaining a web stack.

## Requirements
- Familiarity with web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
- Understanding of database management systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Basic knowledge of network protocols and tools.
- Access to a Linux-based system for testing and debugging.

## Project Tasks
### Task 0: Fix a Web Server Issue
- **Objective:** Identify and resolve an issue causing the web server to fail.
- **Steps:**
  1. Investigate server logs to find error messages.
  2. Debug configuration files for errors or misconfigurations.
  3. Apply the necessary fixes and restart the web server.
  4. Verify that the web server is functioning correctly.

### Task 1: Troubleshoot Application Errors
- **Objective:** Diagnose and fix issues within the web application.
- **Steps:**
  1. Examine application logs for error messages.
  2. Check application dependencies and configurations.
  3. Correct any identified issues and redeploy the application.
  4. Ensure the application is running as expected.

### Task 2: Resolve Database Connection Problems
- **Objective:** Address problems related to database connectivity.
- **Steps:**
  1. Review database server logs for errors.
  2. Verify database configuration settings.
  3. Test database connection from the web application.
  4. Fix any issues and confirm database connectivity.

### Task 3: Network Troubleshooting
- **Objective:** Fix network-related issues affecting the web stack.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use network diagnostic tools (e.g., ping, traceroute) to identify issues.
  2. Check firewall and security group settings.
  3. Resolve any network configuration problems.
  4. Ensure the network is functioning properly.

## Tools and Commands
- **Log Analysis:** `tail`, `grep`, `cat`
- **Web Server Management:** `systemctl`, `service`
- **Database Management:** `mysql`, `psql`
- **Network Diagnostics:** `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`

## Conclusion
Web stack debugging is a crucial skill for maintaining a robust and reliable web infrastructure. This project provides hands-on experience in identifying and fixing common issues in web servers, applications, databases, and networks. Through these tasks, you will enhance your ability to troubleshoot and ensure the smooth operation of a web stack.
