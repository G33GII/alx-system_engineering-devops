# 0x0F. Load Balancer

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of a load balancer, designed to evenly distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, and minimize response time.

## Features
- **Dynamic Routing:** The load balancer dynamically routes incoming requests to backend servers based on predefined algorithms or policies.
- **Health Monitoring:** Monitors the health of backend servers and redistributes traffic to healthy servers to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **Scalability:** Easily scalable to accommodate increased traffic demands by adding more backend servers without disrupting service.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Provides fault tolerance mechanisms to handle server failures gracefully and maintain continuous service availability.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Logs and monitors traffic distribution, server health, and performance metrics for analysis and optimization purposes.
- **Customizable Configuration:** Allows customization of load balancing algorithms, health check parameters, and other configuration settings to suit specific requirements.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the project directory
    cd <project_directory>

    # Install dependencies
    npm install  # or any other package manager you're using
    ```

3. Configure load balancer settings:
    ```bash
    # Edit configuration files to define load balancing algorithms, backend server settings, health check parameters, etc.
    ```

4. Start the load balancer:
    ```bash
    # Start the load balancer server
    npm start  # or any other command to start the server
    ```
